## BIOGRAPHY

Dr. Jiahui Jin is an associate professor in School of Computer Science and Engineering at Southeast University, China. He received the Ph.D. degree from Southeast University in 2015, supervised by Professor Junzhou Luo. During his Ph.D. study from Aug. 2012 to Aug. 2014, he had spent two years working in Multimedia Networking & Internet Lab (MNIL) at University of Massachusetts Amherst as a visiting Ph.D. student with Professor Lixin Gao (IEEE Fellow, ACM Fellow).

I am looking for highly motivated and self-driven master students, who are interested in developing distributed systems for query processing, data mining, and machine learning.

## RESEARCH INTERESTS

- **Big Data**. Distributed Data Processing, Crowd Sourcing
- **Cloud Computing**. Virtual Machine, Data Center Networking
- **Knowledge Graph**. Querying, Subgraph Matching
